I love coding. I'm self-taught and everything I create is infused with the magic that pulled me to coding in the first place.

I also esteem the open-source community and am passionate about supporting the work of other creators. I make monthly donations to open-source projects and non-profitable organizations, such as:

- [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)
- [Gnome Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org)
- [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org)
- [Libadawaita for Firefox](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme)
- [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org)
- [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org)
- [Make-A-Wish Foundation](https://makeawish.pt)
- [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org)
